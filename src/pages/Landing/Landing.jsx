                    I moved overseas five years ago pursuing a better life. Well, life now presents different challenges
                    that I can't label as better or worse. However, I am sure that this journey helped me grow. From a
                    teaching and artistic background, I've ended up following a childhood wishâ€”that was to work with
                    technology. After a couple of years studying and dedicating my time to learning software
                    development, here I am.
